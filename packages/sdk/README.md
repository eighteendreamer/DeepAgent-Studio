# @deepagent/sdk

TypeScript client for the DeepAgent Harness app-server.

The default transport starts `deepagent server --transport stdio`. A custom
binary can be supplied with `command`, `args`, and `cwd`.

```ts
import { DeepAgent } from "@deepagent/sdk";

const agent = new DeepAgent({ transport: "stdio" });
const thread = await agent.startThread({ cwd: process.cwd() });
for await (const event of thread.runStreamed("inspect the repository")) {
  console.log(event);
}
await agent.close();
```

`cli-jsonl` is available for one-shot automation through `runJsonl(prompt)`.
Thread lifecycle and turn control require the stdio app-server transport.
